# RoyalTerraria14Content
New content mod for the fourteenth Royal Terraria

Added some new cool yet very broken weapons that may or may not lead to massive destruction and exploits.

### Bane of Krush Gull
"The floating sword of the Royal Terror"

![pretty cool huh? I drew it :3](https://github.com/royal-games/RoyalTerraria14Content/blob/master/Items/BaneOfKrushGull.png?raw=true)

A huge melee weapon, with knockback so high it sends enemies to the sky. 

Adds a Bleeding Debuff for 5 seconds.  
Damage = 120;  
Usetime = 1 second;  
KnockBack = 20;  
SellPrice = 8 Gold;  
Craftable with 666 FleshBlock, 66 CrimtaneBar and 66 TissueSample near a mythril anvil.  

### Dynapistol
"Shoots lit dynamite"

![pretty cool huh? I drew it :3](https://github.com/royal-games/RoyalTerraria14Content/blob/master/Items/Dynapistol.png?raw=true)

A ranged weapon? May seem like it, but it's actually a gunpowder powered powerfull Throwing weapon.
Simply shoots lit dynamite at accelerated rate and extended range... What could go wrong?
Damage = 250;
KnockBack = 0;
Usetime = 0.33 seconds;
SellPrice = 6 Gold; 
Craftable with Flintlock Pistol, Illegal Gun Parts and 10 Wood near any anvil. 

### Morning Sword
"It isn't a spear anymore"
![pretty cool huh? I drew it :3](https://github.com/royal-games/RoyalTerraria14Content/blob/master/Items/MorningSword.png?raw=true)

Now what the hell is this? It's just a very poor artwork with a stupid idea behind it, a sword melted won top to make a morning star.
Damage = 26;
KnockBack = 6.5;
Usetime = 0.5 seconds;
SellPrice = 1 Gold 50 Silver; 
Craftable with Spear, Short Sword and a prehardmode Morning Star near any envil.
