A huge melee weapon, with knockback so high it sends enemies to the sky.

![pretty cool huh? I drew it :3](https://github.com/royal-games/RoyalTerraria14Content/blob/master/Items/Dynapistol.png?raw=true)

A ranged weapon? May seem like it, but it's actually a gunpowder powered powerfull Throwing weapon.
Simply shoots lit dynamite at accelerated rate and extended range... What could go wrong?

![pretty cool huh? I drew it :3](https://github.com/royal-games/RoyalTerraria14Content/blob/master/Items/MorningSword.png?raw=true)

Now what the hell is this? It's just a very poor artwork with a stupid idea behind it, a sword melted won top to make a morning star. Does melee damage.
