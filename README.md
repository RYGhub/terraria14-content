# RoyalTerraria14Content
New content mod for the fourteenth Royal Terraria

Added some new cool yet very broken weapons that may or may not lead to massive destruction and exploits.

Bane of Krush Gull

![pretty cool huh? I drew it :3](https://github.com/royal-games/RoyalTerraria14Content/blob/master/Items/BaneOfKrushGull.png?raw=true)
A huge melee weapon, with knockback so high it sends enemies to the sky.
